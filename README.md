KJV PowerShell Module
This PowerShell module provides access to the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible using the Bible API. You can retrieve Bible verses directly from your terminal by specifying the book, chapter, and verse.

To install and use the module, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Usage
With the module imported, you can now retrieve any verse from the Bible using the Read-Bible function. For example, to get John 3:16, use the following command:

powershell
Copy code
Read-Bible -Book "John" -Chapter 3 -Verse 16

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
How It Works
The Read-Bible function sends a request to the Bible API to fetch the specified verse. It handles any errors or issues with the request and returns the verse text if available.
